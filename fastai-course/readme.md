# Notes from the FastAI course

This project is built along taking the [FastAI Course](https://course.fast.ai/). Based on prior experience, using websearch may be problematic on Kaggle, Colab and similar.

## Chapters

1. Installed CUDA-enabled PyTorch to use laptop GPU - https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
